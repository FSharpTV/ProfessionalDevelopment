#Professional Development:
##Creating the domain with the F# Type System and unit testing with FsUnit

###Introduction

In this course our aim is to help the student **gain more FP concepts**, put those concepts into practice. We will also expose the the student to some **open source libraries**. We will be taking a specification, breaking it down so that the thought process for re-creating the specifications in F# source code can be experienced.

We will use the **rich typing system of F#** to constrain our types and demonstrate the succinctness of **developing a domain** using the F# type system. The main thing to be focused on during this section is unit testing with a popular **F# testing** framework. For this we will use a game of poker as our subject matter. The main areas to cover in this course will be the following:

* **Domain designing with types, following a specification**

* **Designing modules and functions that expose the developer to FP concepts**

* **Unit test the functionality using FsUnit**

Specification for lecture purposes to deliver the three parts identified.

A game of cards will first of all require that a deck of cards exists, for this we will need to create the deck of 52 standard playing cards. We will create an ***ubiquitous language*** to represent our domain and start from the very basic principles and building on those principles to create a usable domain.

Things we will encounter may include the Microsoft libraries for **reflecting** F# types, more specifically enumerating discriminated unions.
